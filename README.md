        <p>This repository has been purposefully created to serve as my <strong>personal record of activities</strong> as I embark on my journey as a Python novice.</p>
        <p>However, it is also intended to be a valuable educational resource for you, as I plan to document my progress and understanding of the language here.</p>
        <p>This documentation will encompass a variety of <em>exercises</em>, <em>explanations</em>, <em>notes</em>, and <em>small projects</em>, spanning from the <strong>beginner level</strong> to the <strong>intermediate level</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you feel comfortable, please <strong>fork</strong> the repository and <em>make</em> any <em>necessary additions</em> or <em>modifications</em>.</p>
        <p>You can contact me via a <em>pull request (PR)</em> or by <em>sending an email</em> to <a href="mailto:brumassiip@gmail.com">brumassiip@gmail.com</a>.</p>

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main skill levels:

1. **Beginner**: Designed for those who are new to Python, this section provides basic explanations, easy-to-follow activities, and simple exercises to help you get started.

2. **Basic**: For those with some Python experience, this section offers a deeper dive into Python concepts, along with exercises and classwork assignments to reinforce your learning.

3. **Intermediate**: Aimed at more experienced Python developers, this section includes more advanced topics, homework assignments, and small projects to challenge your skills.

Inside each level, you will find two folders:

- **üè´ | Classwork**: This folder contains class assignments and explanations for in-class activities.

- **üè† | Homework**: Here, you'll find assignments to complete on your own, often with more complexity to further your understanding.
