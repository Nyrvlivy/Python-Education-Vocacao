## Introduction

This repository has been purposefully created to serve as my **personal record of activities** as I embark on my journey as a Python novice.

However, it is also intended to be a valuable educational resource for you, as I plan to document my progress and understanding of the language here.

This documentation will encompass a variety of _exercises_, _explanations_, _notes_, and _small projects_, spanning from the **beginner level** to the **intermediate level**.

If you feel comfortable, please **fork** the repository and _make_ any _necessary additions_ or _modifications_.

You can contact me via a _pull request (PR)_ or by _sending an email_ to [brumassiip@gmail.com](mailto:brumassiip@gmail.com).

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main skill levels:

1. **Beginner**: Designed for those who are new to Python, this section provides basic explanations, easy-to-follow activities, and simple exercises to help you get started.

2. **Basic**: For those with some Python experience, this section offers a deeper dive into Python concepts, along with exercises and classwork assignments to reinforce your learning.

3. **Intermediate**: Aimed at more experienced Python developers, this section includes more advanced topics, homework assignments, and small projects to challenge your skills.

Inside each level, you will find two folders:

- **üè´ | Classwork**: This folder contains class assignments and explanations for in-class activities.

- **üè† | Homework**: Here, you'll find assignments to complete on your own, often with more complexity to further your understanding.

## How to Navigate
